                            <p>In the most of the cases, only the sufferer hears these annoying noises; however, in some
                                rare cases, the physician is also able to hear these noises caused by the irregular
                                blood
                                flow in the arteries. These rare cases are the sign of objective tinnitus, while the
                                more
                                common condition is called subjective tinnitus.

                                Subjective tinnitus can affect either one or both your ears, depending on how serious
                                the
                                problem is and how much damage it has caused to your brain.

                                There can be multiple causes of this frustrating condition and it is near impossible to
                                trace down what exactly might trigger it. Many researchers categorize this disease into
                                four
                                types- acute, chronic, subjective, and objective.</p>
                            <p>You have to understand one thing here, that if you think tinnitus can be ignored and if
                                you
                                feel that tinnitus would probably just go off in some time on its own, then you are
                                straight
                                away wrong and if you dare to ignore this condition, you might face serious implications
                                later on in life. Going with Sonus Complete in order to end this constant annoyance
                                might be
                                your only best shot.</p>
                            <p>
                                Here is an interesting fact, Sonus Complete was developed by one of the member of MENSA,
                                Gregory Peters.

                                Peter himself was going through with this same condition of ringing noises. He committed
                                himself to find a solution to this problem. After 10 years of deep research and testing
                                of
                                several herbal solutions to this problem he came up with this miraculous formula, later
                                which was formed into a product which is known as Sonus Complete.
                            </p>
                            <p>Peter understands the root of this problem and its seriousness, and after years of
                                extensive
                                research he developed Sonus Complete. He made this easy solution as a health supplement
                                to
                                help human body deal with this problem naturally without any other harm.

                                He has relied only on all-natural ingredients that are medically proven to help heal the
                                damaged pathways in the brain without causing any harm.
                                There is absolutely no doubt about the fact that all the ingredients are driven from the
                                best sources and hence the product is guaranteed for its safety and effectiveness. I
                                will
                                tell you more about its all-natural ingredients below, so for now continue reading.</p>

                            <li>Hawthorn Berry</li>
                            <p>This herb has anti-inflammatory properties that may help the major causes behind
                                tinnitus. It also reduces blood fats, lowers blood pressure, and prevents heart-related
                                conditions.</p>

                            <li>Juniper Berry</li>
                            <p>Another herb famous for its anti-inflammatory properties, Juniper Berry, also it comes in
                                useful to treat hearing-related problems.

                                It has antibacterial and antifungal properties, which is why it is also called a wonder

                            <li>Uva Ursi</li>
                            <p>A common cause of hearing loss is inflammation in arteries. Uva Ursi significantly
                                reduces inflammation, which in turn provides relief from tinnitus.</p>
                            <li>Hibiscus</li>
                            <p>You will find hibiscus in a host of organic dietary supplements because of its medicinal
                                properties. The herb contains antioxidants and can improve the functioning of the
                                nervous system and prevent liver damage.</p>
                            <li>Vitamin C, B12, and B6</li>
                            <p>Deficiency of these vitamins in your diet plan could be the major issue of tinnitus.
                                Replenishing these nutrients can reverse the damage to an extent.

                                These vitamins help improve brain function, prevent muscular degeneration, and boost
                                immunity. These also support bone growth and production of red blood cells in your body.
                            </p>
                            <li>Niacin</li>
                            <p>Vitamin B3, which is commonly known as Niacin. Its primary function is to lower
                                cholesterol levels in your body. But importantly for tinnitus patients, it boosts brain
                                function and improves memory too.

                                The body, though, needs just a small amount of Niacin. Sonus Complete has put a minimal
                                amount of vitamins to ensure there are no side effects from this.</p>

                            <li>Garlic</li>
                            <p>Although vampires hate garlic but it can be mighty useful in treating tinnitus. It also
                                reduces inflammation and improves blood circulation.

                                As a result, blood smoothly flows through all parts of your body without any rise in
                                blood pressure levels. A smooth blood flow relieves much of tinnitus symptoms and
                                ensures proper brain function.</p>

                            <li>Green Tea</li>
                            <p>Several research supports that green tea leaves or green tea extracts help relieve blood
                                pressure levels in the ear. Green tea can help improve your brain’s operational
                                capacity. It has powerful levels of antioxidants in it.

                                Additionally, it can help rejuvenate your deteriorating neural connections so as to
                                improve your overall aural capabilities in a total natural manner.</p>
                            <li>Olive Leaves</li>
                            <p>Olive leaves naturally treat gastroenteritis, because they have antimicrobial, antibiotic
                                as well as anti-cancer properties. But the most important of its benefits in Sonus
                                Complete is that it protects the central nervous system.

                                It also has an abundance of antioxidants, which also helps reduce inflammation and

                                proven to do that effectively.</p>
                            <li>Bucha Leaves</li>
                            <p>Historically, Bucha leaves have been used in medicines to treat urinary tract infections
                                or diuretic. Its anti-inflammatory properties are the primary reason for it being used
                                in Sonus Complete.

                                Bucha Leaves are also effective in treating rheumatism, bladder problems as well as to

                                    The main issue with neural treatment is that the supplements can have significant side
                                    effects. Moreover, the chances of contracting the side effects are at times more than
                                    that of healing the disease. But Sonus complete is a risk-free solution. This health
                                    supplement improves a lot of internal functions in the body and ensures a holistic
                                    health improvement.</p>
